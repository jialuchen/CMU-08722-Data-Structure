     * Instead of using String's hashCode, you are to implement your own here.
     * You need to take the table length into your account in this method.
     *
     * In other words, you are to combine the following two steps into one step.
     * 1. converting Object into integer value
     * 2. compress into the table using modular hashing (division method)
     *
     * Helper method to hash a string for English lowercase alphabet and blank,
     * we have 27 total. But, you can assume that blank will not be added into
     * your table. Refer to the instructions for the definition of words.
     *
     * For example, "cats" : 3*27^3 + 1*27^2 + 20*27^1 + 19*27^0 = 60,337
     *
     * But, to make the hash process faster, Horner's method should be applied as follows;
     *
     * var4*n^4 + var3*n^3 + var2*n^2 + var1*n^1 + var0*n^0 can be rewritten as
     * (((var4*n + var3)*n + var2)*n + var1)*n + var0
     *
     * Note: You must use 27 for this homework.
     *
     * However, if you have time, I would encourage you to try with other
     * constant values than 27 and compare the results but it is not required.
     * @param input input string for which the hash value needs to be calculated
     * @return int hash value of the input string
